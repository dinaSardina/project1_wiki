# API

An **application programming interface (API)** is a connection between computers or between computer programs. It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software. A document or standard that describes how to build or use such a connection or interface is called an *API specification*. A computer system that meets this standard is said to implement or expose an API. The term API may refer either to the specification or to the implementation.
